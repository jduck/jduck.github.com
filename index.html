<h2>Background</h2>
I am an autodidact that is insatiably curious about myriad security topics,
including; computer architectures, Linux and Android internals, reverse engineering,
vulnerability research, and secure development.
<br/><br />
My first time on the internet involved an external 2400 baud dial-up modem.
Going all the way back to the BBS days, I showed a propensity for security research, aka "What happens when I do this?"
This innate skill has served me well throughout the years and provided quite an interesting career.


<h2>Contact Details</h2>

If there is something you think I can help you with, feel free to reach out.
I am in the "don't ask to ask" camp, so feel fre to PM away. If you see "jduck",
it's probably me. Once upon a time, I was on IRC, but not really anymore.
